# Status
In development...cheers!


# Description
This will flesh out to be a playground that allows users to generate graphs and get a visual representation of how a variety of graph algorithms run on it. This is aimed towards helping learners round out their understanding of popular graph algorithms. For graph algorithms, I find that visual perpsectives can be easier for pointing out possible optimizations.

This is aimed towards being user friendly! The application will be delivered as a downloadable executable for various OS.

**Graph Algorithms Included**
* DFS + variants
* BFS + variants
* Dijkstra
* Beam Search + variants
* Hill Climb + variants
* A\*
* Miscalleous Graph Transformations


# Motivation
I was inspired by a tool used in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjZBTDzGeGg&list=PLUl4u3cNGP63gFHB6xb-kVBiQHYe_4hSi">MIT 6.034 Artificial Intelligence, Fall 2010 Series</a>. Having just finished my last QT project, I figured this would be a good practice exercise. I'm also planning on using it to visualize any experimental graph algorithms I might play with in the future.
