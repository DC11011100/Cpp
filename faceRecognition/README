Accidentally pushed a buggy version, but I also need to clean up the code a bit. So, as of right now this is in beta until I have more time again to improve it.
Here's a video of the working project. I'll be migrating it to a QT app so that it's more easily used by a wider population. Until then,

FACIAL RECOGNITION
Faces are detected and stored using the 'c' command.
Pressing 'c' then crops, histogram equalizes, and stores a sample image into "./training_samples"
Histogram Equalization helps diminish the influence of varied light conditions.


Try to take a roughly equal number of positive and negative images to ensure non-biased SVM
