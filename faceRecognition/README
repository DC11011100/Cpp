FACIAL RECOGNITION
Faces are detected and stored using the 'c' command.
Pressing 'c' then crops, histogram equalizes, and stores a sample image into "./training_samples"
Histogram Equalization helps diminish the influence of varied light conditions.


Try to take a roughly equal number of positive and negative images to ensure non-biased SVM
